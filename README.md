## About

[`Sway`](https://swaywm.org) is a [tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager) window manager for Wayland that emulates the features of [`i3wm`](https://i3wm.org/), plus some extra features.

Sway user configuration is located at either `$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/sway/config` or `~/.config/sway/config`. It is written in what appears to be a custom language.
